<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Examining Report Fields**

I'm currently investigating the `reportedBy` and `reportedByUID` fields within the `reports.js` model. It seems like these might hold the key to linking reports to the specific users who lodged them. I'm trying to figure out how to extract the user's name from this information to populate the desired "User" field in the `ReportManagement.jsx` table.


**Assessing File Structure**

I've started by reading `ReportManagement.jsx` to understand the current table structure. Now I'm reviewing the existing table headers and the data rendering logic within the table body. The plan is to add a "User" header and then implement the rendering of the `reportedBy` field within each table row. This seems straightforward, so I can focus on precisely locating the table's components.

Of course. I'll add a "User" field to the `ReportManagement` page to display the name of the user who filed the report. First, I will examine the `client/src/pages/ReportManagement.jsx` file to understand the existing table structure.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing the Code**

I'm starting to examine the `Report Management.jsx` file. I need to understand the structure before I start adding anything. My first step is to add a table header for the User. It should be a basic table header.


**Implementing the Header**

I've successfully added the "User" header to the table. Now, it's time to move on to adding the corresponding data cell within the `<tbody>` section, ensuring the user's name is displayed for each report. After that, I'll address the search filter to include `reportedBy`. I'm using the `edit_file` tool now to make the updates.

Okay, I've reviewed the code for `ReportManagement.jsx` and have a clear plan. I'll now add the "User" column to the table, including the header and the corresponding data cell for each report. I will also update the search functionality to include searching by the user's name.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Incorporating User Data**

I've successfully implemented the "User" field within the `ReportManagement.jsx` component. This involves displaying the `reportedBy` data in a new table column and integrating user-based search filtering. The integration seems to be working as expected.


**Assessing Code Quality**

I'm now running the linter. I'm double-checking all my recent edits to the `ReportManagement.jsx` component, focusing on the new user-related integrations. The main aim is to identify and resolve any potential code quality issues before proceeding.


</details></think>

---

I've added the "User" field to the `ReportManagement.jsx` page, which includes updating the table to display the user's name from the `reportedBy` data and adding the user's name to the search filter. Now, I'll check for any linting errors.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Verifying Completion**

I've successfully verified that there are no linter errors. Furthermore, I've added the requested "User" column to the `ReportManagement` page. It now correctly displays the submitter's name. The user's request is now completed.


**Finalizing Implementation Steps**

I've successfully updated the search functionality for the `ReportManagement` page; users can now search by submitter name. I believe this completes the user's requirements. I am ready for final validation.


</details></think>

I've updated the `ReportManagement.jsx` file to include a "User" column in the reports table, which will show the name of the user who created the report. I've also enhanced the search functionality to allow you to filter reports by the user's name.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
