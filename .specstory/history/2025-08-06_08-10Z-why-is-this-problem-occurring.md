I can see the error from your terminal output. The problem is that the code is trying to import a module called `User` from `../models/User`, but the actual file is named `users.js` (lowercase and plural).

Let me check the current files to confirm the issue and fix it:

---

Read file: routes/userRoutes.js

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory models â€¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `users.js` |

</details>

---

Perfect! I can see the issue clearly now. The problem is on line 4 of `userRoutes.js`:

**Problem:** 
- The import statement is `const User = require("../models/User");`
- But the actual file is named `users.js` (not `User.js`)

**Solution:** Fix the import path to match the actual filename.

That's it! The problem was a simple case-sensitivity and naming mismatch:

- **File exists as:** `models/users.js` 
- **Import was trying to load:** `models/User` (capital U and no .js extension)

Node.js is case-sensitive, so `User` â‰  `users`. The fix changes the import from:
```javascript
const User = require("../models/User");
```

To:
```javascript
const User = require("../models/users");
```

Now your server should start properly! Try running `npm start` again.
