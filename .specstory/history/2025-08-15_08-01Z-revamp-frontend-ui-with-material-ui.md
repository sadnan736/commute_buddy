<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning UI Revamp**

I need to revamp the frontend UI to implement Material UI while keeping the logic and routing intact. I'm working with Vite React and Tailwind config. My plan involves installing MUI packages, wrapping ThemeProvider/CssBaseline, and refactoring components to utilize MUI. I also need to preserve the existing state and API logic. I'll scan the codebase, looking mainly at App.jsx, index.jsx, and the current layout to check for heavy CSS usage. I'll use the terminal command to run package installations seamlessly.
**Considering Migration to MUI**

I’m thinking about migrating to Material UI while keeping Tailwind as a utility if needed. Since the user wants a modernized look, I'll focus on MUI for the primary design. My plan includes creating a theme file in `client/src/theme.js or .jsx`, depending on the project’s extension. I also need to wrap the ThemeProvider in `index.jsx`. Pages like `AdminDashboard`, `Dashboard`, and others will be updated to MUI components. Additionally, I'll consider installing the Roboto font and the icon package to enhance the UI.
**Preparing for Development**

I need to run `npm install` commands in the `client` directory, using `run_terminal_cmd` to execute `cd client && npm install ...`. I'll ensure that the Vite dev server works, but I can't run it for the user; instead, I can run it in the background and ask them to preview it. The instructions mention running tests or builds, but I'm unsure if tests exist; there's an `App.test.jsx`, but it may not work with Vite. I’ll focus on checking for linter errors with the `read_lints` tool, although I'm unsure if it’s configured correctly.
**Implementing Code Changes**

I'm planning to implement code changes across key components until the problem is solved. First, I'll scan the code using functions like `list_dir` in `client/src` to list files, followed by `read_file` for entry points. I'll also use `codebase_search` for routing info and grep to find Tailwind class usages that need modification. The prompt suggests we treat "Potentially Relevant AI Web Search Results" as guidance. I’ll read key files, like `index.jsx`, `App.jsx`, and specific components, plus `AdminDashboard`. I'll keep API-related files intact and limit my parallel reads to around 5 files.
**Planning Parallel Reads**

I'm setting up my first round of parallel reads to gather important information efficiently. I plan to read `client/src/index.jsx`, `client/src/App.jsx`, as well as components like `Navbar.jsx`, `LoadingSpinner.jsx`, and `Toast.jsx`. I also want to look at `AdminDashboard.jsx` in the pages directory. Additionally, I'll check `client/vite.config.js` to ensure the plugin configuration is correct. I'll execute multiple `read_file` calls in parallel to optimize the process.</details></think>

I'll scan the key frontend files to understand the current structure and identify where to integrate Material UI while preserving logic and routing. Then I'll proceed to install and wire up MUI with a custom theme and refactor core UI components.

I’m looking to modernize the UI with MUI, while keeping the logic intact. The current frontend uses Tailwind classes a lot, so I'll add MUI packages and set up a theme with CssBaseline. I’ll wrap the App with ThemeProvider and replace components like Navbar and LoadingSpinner with MUI components, being careful not to break the existing logic. 

We’re getting ready to revamp the frontend, and I need to check the client's package.json for react-router-dom version, likely v6.</details></think>
