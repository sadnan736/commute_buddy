by this create a .env file at root

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a `.env` file at the root of your project with the configuration values from the document.

---



---

I've created the `.env` file at the root of your project with the configuration values you specified:

- `PORT=4321` - Server port configuration
- `MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/userprofiledb` - Local MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET=@mus@sad@mush@471` - JWT signing secret

The file is now ready for your application to use these environment variables for configuration.

Let me use the `edit_file` tool to write the environment variables back to the `.env` file.

<details><summary>Edit file: .env</summary>

I will add the environment variables to the .env file.

Perfect! I've written the environment variables back to the `.env` file:

- `PORT=4321` - Server port configuration
- `MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/userprofiledb` - Local MongoDB connection string  
- `JWT_SECRET=@mus@sad@mush@471` - JWT signing secret

The `.env` file is now properly configured with all the necessary environment variables for your application.

why this error

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error, the issue is that MongoDB is not running on your system. The error `connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017, connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017` indicates that your application is trying to connect to MongoDB on localhost:27017, but MongoDB server is not running.

Here are the solutions:

## Option 1: Install and Start MongoDB Locally


---

```bash
mongod --version
```

```
PS D:\commute_buddy> mongod --version
PS D:\commute_buddy> mongod --version




























mongod : The term 'mongod' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or 
operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is 
correct and try again.

MongoDB is not installed on your system. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Install MongoDB Community Edition
1. Download MongoDB Community Server from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
2. Install it following the installation wizard
3. Start the MongoDB service

## Option 2: Use MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database) - Recommended
This is easier and doesn't require local installation. Let me help you set up MongoDB Atlas:

1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/atlas
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new cluster (free tier)
4. Get your connection string
5. Update your `.env` file with the Atlas connection string

## Option 3: Use Docker (if you have Docker installed)


---

```bash
docker --version
```

```

PS D:\commute_buddy> docker --version
Docker version 28.0.1, build 068a01e
```

---

Great! You have Docker installed. Let's use Docker to run MongoDB:


---

```bash
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
```

```

PS D:\commute_buddy> docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
docker: error during connect: Head "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping": open //./p
ipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.


Run 'docker run --help' for more information
```

---

Docker Desktop is not running. Let me start it:


---

```bash
start "Docker Desktop" "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"
```

---

Let me wait a moment for Docker Desktop to start and then try running MongoDB:


---

```bash
timeout /t 10 /nobreak
```

```
PS D:\commute_buddy> timeout /t 10 /nobreak

Waiting for  0 seconds, press CTRL+C to quit ...
PS D:\commute_buddy>
```

---

Now let's try running MongoDB with Docker:


---

```bash
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
```

```
PS D:\commute_buddy>
```
